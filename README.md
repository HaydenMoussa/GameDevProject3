# GameDevProject3

Name: It's Only Natural

Intent: A platformer with power-ups and obstacles.

Narrative Structure: You are a bunny being guided by a game master who tells you that your sole purpose is to find food. As you search, you stumble upon a carrot but this is no ordinary carrot. It grants you the ability to double jump, unlocking a new section of the stage where you can find more food and ultimately complete the game.

Mechanics: WASD movement, space to jump and double jump.

Aesthetics: Forests/wilderness, pixel art.

Joys and Struggles Hayden-

I enjoyed creating the animations for the bunny; once they were finished and looking good, I felt very accomplished. However, the animations were also my biggest struggle. The sprites in our character sprite sheet are not all the same size, which caused a lot of trouble making the animations look fluid.

Contributions Hayden-

I created the repository and implemented movement along with animations to bring the character to life. I designed the tilemap and grid system, as well as a parallax background to enhance the game's depth. Additionally, I developed the dialogue scripts and structured the storyline that guides the player's progression. I also incorporated custom fonts, designed the main menu and credits screen, and programmed the majority of the game's scripts.

Joys and Struggles Mason-

I enjoyed creating the buffs and messing with the level of their effects on the bunnies' movement. I initially struggled getting the traps to properly detect and eliminate the player with their hitboxes. 

Contributions Mason-

I fleshed out the map, adding some of the parkour elements as well as the traps. I implemented the traps, their hitboxes, and their collision scripts which damage/eliminate the player. I also added the buff system and 
it's associated scripts as well as their appearance and glow effects. I also implemented the characters double jump and helped design the dialogue appearance and scripts.
